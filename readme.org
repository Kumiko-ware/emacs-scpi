* This is a library for accessing measure instruments from EMACS

** It allows:
- Send and receive from equipment supporting "raw" SCPI and VXI-11
- LeCroy oscilloscopes (VICP)
- VÃ¶tsch temperature chambers
- Generate LaTeX measurement reports
- Generate graphics with GNU Plot

** Use

*** VXI-11 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/devel/utils/vxi") ;; Or where the VXI is
(require 'gpib) ;; Load lib

(gpib-new 'gen "192.168.17.125" "gpib0,10") ;; Make new instrument "GEN"
;; Note the address 10

(gen "*IDN?") ;; Do something
(gen :terminate) ;; Release the allocated resources
#+END_SRC

*** SCPI (raw socket)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/devel/utils") ;; Or where the lib is
(require 'scpi) ;; Load lib

(scpi-new 'analyser "192.168.2.30") ;; Make new instrument "ANALYSER"

(analyser "*IDN?") ;; Do Something, for example get a screenshot
(analyser ":HCOP:DEV:LANG1 PNG; *WAI")
(analyser ":MMEM:NAME \'C:\\R_S\\INSTR\\USER\\PRINT1.PNG\'; *WAI")
(analyser ":HCOP:IMM1; *WAI")
(analyser :cmd-to-file "screen.png" ":MMEM:DATA? 'C:\\R_S\\INSTR\\USER\\PRINT1.PNG'")

(analyser :terminate) ;; Release the allocated resources
#+END_SRC

*** LeCroy Oscilloscopes (VICP)

This is differente because those scopes have some propietary
interface, which is more convenient than SCPI.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/devel/utils") ;; Or where the lib is
(require 'vicp) ;; Load lib

(vicp-new 'osc "192.168.1.1")

(osc "%s" "*IDN?")
(osc :init-default)
(osc :snapshot "./test.png")
(osc :cmd-to-file "wave-c1.lwf" "c%d:WF? ALL" 1)
(osc :cmd-to-file "wave-c2.lwf" "c%d:WF? ALL" 2)
(osc :cmd-to-file "wave-c2.lwf" "c%d:WF? ALL" 3)
(osc :cmd-to-file "wave-c2.lwf" "c%d:WF? ALL" 4)

(osc :terminate)
#+END_SRC

*** Reporting -- LaTeX must be installed in the system

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/devel/utils") ;; Or where the VXI is
(require 'report) ;; Load lib

(report-new 'my-rep "/tmp/my-rep.org")
(my-rep :clear) ;; clear file if it existed
(my-rep :title "Hello world")
(my-rep :picture :file "/tmp/pic.png")
(my-rep :save)
(my-rep :export-pdf)

(my-rep :terminate)
#+END_SRC

*** Graphics -- GNU Plot must be installed in the system

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/devel/utils") ;; Or where the VXI is
(require 'plotter) ;; Load lib

TBD

(my-rep :terminate)
#+END_SRC

*** Temp chamber

Maybe better do not use. Deprecated. I'm not even sure for what models
it would work. There is an usage example in the code. No warranty.
